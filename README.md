Daily Task - The Secure & Private Task Manager

Daily Task is a modern, intuitive, and secure task management application designed for individuals who want to stay organized and productive without compromising their privacy. Unlike cloud-based solutions, all user data is stored locally on the device, ensuring complete privacy and security. The app provides a powerful set of tools to manage daily tasks, set priorities, and receive actionable reminders — all from a simple, clean interface.

This repository contains the source code for the Daily Task application. We’ve built it with a strong focus on a seamless user experience, a robust feature set, and a privacy-first architecture.
